# Agents Status - Zenyatta Container

**Location:**
- Host: `~/ai-playground/.container_share/zenyatta/agents.md`
- Container: `/home/developer/.local/share/zenyatta/agents.md`

---

## Startup Rule

**READ FIRST:** `/home/developer/.local/share/zenyatta/claude.md`
That file has your constraints, file system layout, and workflow.

**Then read this file** for project context.

**Do NOT** explore the codebase, scan directories, or read other files until the user tells you what to work on. Start lean -- only load context you need.
